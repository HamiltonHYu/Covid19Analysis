<h1>South Korea Covid-19 Patient Data Analysis</h1>

<h3>Business Case:</h3>

Analyze South Korea's CDC patient level data to determine how best to combat the rapidly spreading pandemic.

<h3>Goal:</h3>

Develop a plan to fight Covid-19

<h3>Source:</h3>

<h3>Strategies:</h3>

*Identify and remove irrelevant features

*Determine what population is the most vulnerable

*Determine actions that can be taken to limit the spread of the disease

<h3>Findings:</h3>

1. The elderly (those 60 and older) are our most at risk population.

2. Venues for large social gatherings were a significant contributor to fections

3. Social distancing campaigns, mask sales, and delayed school openings coincided with a decreased spread of the disease.

4. If people do recover after contracting the illness, age and sex generally did not have an outsized impact except for the very old or those who are quite young.

<h3>Predictions:</h3>
If steps are taken to protect the elderly and policies like delaying school openings, social distancing, shutting down venues for social gatherings and encouraging mask use/making them high available we can expect to see a significant reduction in the spread of the disease.

<h3>Improvements:</h3>
There were a number of missing data points that were hard to fill in for which skewed the data in a certain way I wasn't entirely comfortable with. For instance there were definitely some males in their 80s that were released (though many died) but their profiles were not complete enough to analyze their convalesence period.

I wish I had more time to explore ML models as well to further investigate policy impact.
